# Topics in Deep Learning

This repository consists three assignments and a project we did in the course "Topics in Deep Learning" in Ben-Gurion University.

**The course description:**
In this project we will implement deep learning algorithms which process time-series data. We will explore state-of-the-art approaches from recent years, and we will apply them to data from the stock market, weather forecasting systems, music and images.


## Assignments
1. Train pytorch's CNN from the 60-minutes blitz course.
2. Implement our own ANN/RNN/LSTM layers using pytorch.
3. Use the layers we built in asignment 2 to build ANN/RNN/LSTM networks on the copy task problem.

## Project
### Visualising and Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks.
We implemented almost all of part 4 of the "[visualising and Understanding Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02078.pdf)" paper by Andrej Karpathy, Justin Johnson and Li Fei-Fei.
