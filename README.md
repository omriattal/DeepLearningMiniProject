# Topics in Deep Learning

This repository consists of two assignments required in the course "Topics in Deep Learning" in Ben-Gurion University and our project.

## Assignments
Assignment 2: Implement ANN/RNN/LSTM layers

Assignment 3: Use the layers we built in asignment 2 to build ANN/RNN/LSTM networks on the copy task.

## Project
### Visualising and Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks.
We implemented almost all part 4 of the "[visualising and Understanding Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02078.pdf)" paper by Andrej Karpathy, Justin Johnson and Li Fei-Fei.
